  "body": "#Welcome! \r\n\r\nThis is the first draft of an upcoming blog post about text mining Jane Austen novels, and the potential of this research to ask new research questions. I experiment with text mining tool Voyant and Google Ngrams. As an expanded print version of this project is currently being evaluated for a class, I will update the full analysis of the graphs at a further date. \r\n\r\n[Follow this link for more information about Voyant](http://docs.voyant-tools.org/tools/).\r\n\r\n##Why Text Mine Austen? \r\n\r\n* well-known, canonical work\r\n* texts freely available for download and manipulation using Project Gutenberg \r\n* scholarly and pedagogical importance - how can we keep students interested in reading and analyzing Austen? \r\n\r\n##Google Ngram graph\r\n\r\n* codex is mysterious: represents the relative frequencies of a term or a phrase in all of the books published that year and that are archived on Google books \r\n\r\n![Austen Trends](https://github.com/jennaherdman/Austen-text-mining/blob/master/unspecified.jpeg?raw=true)\r\n\r\n[Follow this link for an interactive version of this graph](https://books.google.com/ngrams/graph?content=Northanger+Abbey%2CPride+and+Prejudice%2CSense+and+Sensibility%2CMansfield+Park&year_start=1800&year_end=2010&corpus=15&smoothing=3&share=&direct_url=t1%3B%2CNorthanger%20Abbey%3B%2Cc0%3B.t1%3B%2CPride%20and%20Prejudice%3B%2Cc0%3B.t1%3B%2CSense%20and%20Sensibility%3B%2Cc0%3B.t1%3B%2CMansfield%20Park%3B%2Cc0). \r\n\r\n###Findings \r\n* opted out of using *Emma* or *Persuasion* as I thought the titles were too generic to return accurate results \r\n* *Pride and Prejudice* is always the most popular \r\n* all of the trends are somewhat similar: when one rises in popularity, so do the other ones \r\n* *Northanger Abbey* is always the least popular - interesting because both NA and P&P were originally written in the late 1790’s, but were revised for publication several years later \r\n* what books are contained in this codex? Are there several reprints of certain books? \r\n\r\n##Romantic Rivalries in Jane Austen \r\n\r\n* used the Terms tool on *Voyant* to look at name frequencies of the romantic hero and rival in four Austen novels \r\n* challenging because need to know which name the author calls him by - i.e. just searching for “Darcy” is insufficient because it might refer to his sister, “Miss Darcy”\r\n* puts a character talking about him on equal footing with an actual appearance  \r\n\r\n###*Pride and Prejudice* \r\n\r\n![Pride and Prejudice](https://github.com/jennaherdman/Austen-text-mining/blob/master/p%20and%20p%20terms.jpeg?raw=true)\r\n\r\n[Follow this link for an interactive version of this graph](http://voyant-tools.org/?corpus=aa5342d4d854354fea80232f149ecf5e&query=wickham*&query=mr%20darcy&withDistributions=raw&docIndex=0&mode=document&view=Trends) \r\n\r\nFindings \r\n* moments of intersection between the two men \r\n* Wickham disappears and reappears consistently - at the end, he becomes important not as a rival for Elizabeth’s heart, but because he elopes with her sister \r\n* Darcy triumphs at the end \r\n\r\n###*Sense and Sensibility* \r\n\r\n![Sense and Sensibility](https://github.com/jennaherdman/Austen-text-mining/blob/master/sense-trends.jpeg?raw=true)\r\n\r\n[Follow this link for an interactive version of this graph](http://voyant-tools.org/?corpus=b521a70350c06325e841ed66af5c4e29&query=colonel&query=willoughby*&withDistributions=raw&mode=document&view=Trends).\r\n\r\n\r\nFindings \r\n* Willoughby appears far more important than Colonel Brandon, except for in the last few segments \r\n* Brandon is steady but not dramatic - the aesthetic quality of the graph reflects the drama of the novel \r\n* in comparison to P&P, Willougby’s trend more closely resembles Darcy’s \r\n\r\n###*Northanger Abbey* and *Mansfield Park*\r\n\r\n\r\n![Northanger Abbey](https://github.com/jennaherdman/Austen-text-mining/blob/master/northanger-trends.png?raw=true)\r\n\r\n[Follow this link for an interactive version of this graph](http://voyant-tools.org/?corpus=e218ddd3ea097161c163a80f75c38f85&query=john|mr.%20thorpe*&query=henry|mr.%20tilney&withDistributions=raw&docIndex=0&mode=document&view=Trends).\r\n\r\n\r\n![Mansfield Park](https://github.com/jennaherdman/Austen-text-mining/blob/master/mansfield.png?raw=true)\r\n\r\n[Follow this link for an interactive version of this graph](http://voyant-tools.org/?corpus=a99f30c20fdc2d887c74f9bc78c2eddf&query=edmund&query=henry|mr.%20crawford&withDistributions=raw&docIndex=0&mode=document&view=Trends).\r\n\r\n\r\nFindings \r\n* far more similar to each other than to P&P and S&S \r\n* the trends in each graph seem to mirror one another in how they increase and decrease \r\n* *Northanger Abbey* sees the hero/husband be more prominent throughout, while in *Mansfield Park* the rival is far more prominent - is there a mistake in the final graph? \r\n* because the final graph is so different from the first three, I am suspicious about its authenticity\r\n\r\n##Links - collocation terms in *Sense and Sensibility* \r\n\r\n![S&S links](https://github.com/jennaherdman/Austen-text-mining/blob/master/sense-collocation.jpeg?raw=true) \r\n\r\n[Follow this link for an interactive version of this graph](http://voyant-tools.org/?corpus=b521a70350c06325e841ed66af5c4e29&mode=corpus&view=CollocatesGraph).\r\n\r\n\r\n* why such a discrepancy between “Marianne” and “Marianne’s”? \r\n* requires a lot of intuition/cultivation by the person using the tool, not simply generated \r\n* necessitates “playing” with the graph \r\n\r\n##Conclusions \r\n\r\n* some of Voyant’s tools are inaccessible, require a lot of concentration in clicking and hand-eye coordination \r\n* the act of creating the graph is a form of reading and analysis: making informed choices about how to structure and program each one \r\n* future studies could look at sentiment analysis by chapter - [see Julia Silge](http://juliasilge.com/blog/Life-Changing-Magic/). \r\n* useful for undergraduate classes: unpacking the text, looking for patterns, critiquing their results \r\n\r\n##Thank you! \r\n\r\n\r\n##Works Cited \r\n\r\nAusten, Jane.
