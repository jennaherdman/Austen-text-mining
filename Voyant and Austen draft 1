#Trends & Tribulations: Text mining Jane Austen Novels 

This is the first draft of an upcoming blog post about text mining Jane Austen novels, and the potential of this research to ask new research questions. I experiment with text mining tool Voyant and Google Ngrams. As an expanded print version of this project is currently being evaluated for a class, I will update the full analysis of the graphs at a further date. 

[Follow this link for more information about Voyant](http://docs.voyant-tools.org/tools/)

##Why Text Mine Austen? 

* well-known, canonical work
* texts freely available for download and manipulation using Project Gutenberg 
* scholarly and pedagogical importance - how can we keep students interested in reading and analyzing Austen? 

##Google Ngram graph

* codex is mysterious: represents the relative frequencies of a term or a phrase in all of the books published that year and that are archived on Google books 

###Graph 

[ ](Follow this link for an interactive version of this graph). 

###Findings 
* opted out of using *Emma* or *Persuasion* as I thought the titles were too generic to return accurate results 
* *Pride and Prejudice* is always the most popular 
* all of the trends are somewhat similar: when one rises in popularity, so do the other ones 
* *Northanger Abbey* is always the least popular - interesting because both NA and P&P were originally written in the late 1790’s, but were revised for publication several years later 
* what books are contained in this codex? Are there several reprints of certain books? 

##Romantic Rivalries in Jane Austen 

* used the Terms tool on *Voyant* to look at name frequencies of the romantic hero and rival in four Austen novels 
* challenging because need to know which name the author calls him by - i.e. just searching for “Darcy” is insufficient because it might refer to his sister, “Miss Darcy”
* puts a character talking about him on equal footing with an actual appearance  

###*Pride and Prejudice*

Findings 
* moments of intersection between the two men 
* Wickham disappears and reappears consistently - at the end, he becomes important not as a rival for Elizabeth’s heart, but because he elopes with her sister 
* Darcy triumphs at the end 

###*Sense and Sensibility* 

![Sense and Sensibility](https://github.com/jennaherdman/Austen-text-mining/blob/master/sense-trends.jpeg?raw=true)

[http://voyant-tools.org/?corpus=b521a70350c06325e841ed66af5c4e29&query=willoughby*&query=willoughby&query=colonel*&withDistributions=raw&docIndex=0&mode=document&view=Trends](Follow this link for an interactive version of this graph). 


Findings 
* Willoughby appears far more important than Colonel Brandon, except for in the last few segments 
* Brandon is steady but not dramatic - the aesthetic quality of the graph reflects the drama of the novel 
* in comparison to P&P, Willougby’s trend more closely resembles Darcy’s 

###*Northanger Abbey* and*Mansfield Park*


![Northanger Abbey](https://github.com/jennaherdman/Austen-text-mining/blob/master/northanger-trends.jpeg?raw=true)

[http://voyant-tools.org/?corpus=e218ddd3ea097161c163a80f75c38f85&query=john|mr.%20thorpe*&query=henry|mr.%20tilney&withDistributions=raw&docIndex=0&mode=document&view=Trends](Follow this link for an interactive version of this graph). 


![Mansfield Park](https://github.com/jennaherdman/Austen-text-mining/blob/master/mansfield.jpeg?raw=true)

[http://voyant-tools.org/?corpus=d6a14f724ec95159d73ecb8c48bb5df4&query=edmund*&query=henry|mr.%20crawford*&withDistributions=raw&docIndex=0&mode=document&view=Trends](Follow this link for an interactive version of this graph). 


Findings 
* far more similar to each other than to P&P and S&S 
* the trends in each graph seem to mirror one another in how they increase and decrease 
* *Northanger Abbey* sees the hero/husband be more prominent throughout, while in *Mansfield Park* the rival is far more prominent - is there a mistake in the final graph? 
* because the final graph is so different from the first three, I am suspicious about its authenticity

##Links - collocation terms in *Sense and Sensibility* 

![S&S links](https://github.com/jennaherdman/Austen-text-mining/blob/master/sense-collocation.jpeg?raw=true)

* why such a discrepancy between “Marianne” and “Marianne’s”? 
* requires a lot of intuition/cultivation by the person using the tool, not simply generated 
* necessitates “playing” with the graph 

##Conclusions 

* some of Voyant’s tools are inaccessible, require a lot of concentration in clicking and hand-eye coordination 
* the act of creating the graph is a form of reading and analysis: making informed choices about how to structure and program each one 
* future studies could look at sentiment analysis by chapter ([see Julia Silge](http://juliasilge.com/blog/Life-Changing-Magic/). 
* useful for undergraduate classes: unpacking the text, looking for patterns, critiquing their results 

##Thank you!
